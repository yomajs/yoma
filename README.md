Yoma is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)-focused [code-first](https://www.prisma.io/blog/series/what-is-nexus-wsobadcm7oju) [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) framework. It has three complementary aspects that you interact with:

1. An API for building your fully featured GraphQL API. All features include a focus on type-safety autocompletion and jsDoc.
2. A CLI for supporting your daily workflows while working.
3. A plugin system spaning API _and_ CLI for rich end-to-end plugins that you can use (or write) to fill in your niche needs.

Yoma is young, but growing fast. [changelog](https://nxs.li/changelog).
